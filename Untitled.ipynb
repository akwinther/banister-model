    "In this tutorial I’ll show how to model the performance of several subjects using the Banister impulse~response (IR) model. Before starting I highly recommend checking out [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728131) fantastic resource by Clarke & Skiba (2013), which I’ll be referencing a lot throughout this post. I also urge you to check out these posts ([here](https://complementarytraining.net/banister-impulseresponse-model-in-r/), and [here](https://complementarytraining.net/predicting-injuries-using-bannister-model/)) by Mladen Jovanovic, where he shares some creative ideas on how to use Banister modelling for both performance and injury prediction. Lastly, the data we’ll be using can be found in [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40422) excellent article by Thierry Busso (2017), who has done a lot of research into the modelling of the dose-response relationship between training and performance. A massive thanks to him and his contribution to open science!\n",
